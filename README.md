                              This project includes functions to manipulate arrays and create user profiles.
        Task 1:
        This function accepts an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with each even number squared and each odd number tripled.
        When given an array of numbers, 'processArray' iterates through each one. The function squares each even element and triples each odd element. The resulting array retains the original element order while applying the specified mathematical transformations.

        Task 2:
